# WasteWiseWeb

WasteWiseWeb is a platform dedicated to reducing global waste by making recycling easier and more accurate. 

Utilizing a web application built with Java with Springboot for the backend, Angular for the frontend and PostgreSQL for the database, we provide users with critical information on proper waste disposal and offer the ability to locate the nearest recycling points in their area. 

What we want to offer:
-Recycling Directory: A comprehensive guide to recyclable materials, detailing what can and cannot be recycled, along with instructions for preparing items for recycling.
-Local Recycling Center Locator: An interactive map that helps users find the closest recycling facilities and drop-off points based on their location.
-Educational Resources: Articles, videos, and infographics to educate users about the importance of recycling and how to do it correctly.

This purpose-driven platform empowers individuals to take small, impactful steps towards a sustainable future by ensuring precious resources are reused more and wasted less. Join us on this mission to become waste-wise and contribute to a cleaner world.
